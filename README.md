## Questions answered

1) We need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50% 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?

2) Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns: Category, Rental length category and Count.

3) We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and
month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

4) We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
